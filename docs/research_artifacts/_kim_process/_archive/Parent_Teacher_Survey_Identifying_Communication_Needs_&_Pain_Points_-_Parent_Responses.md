# Parent & Teacher Survey: Identifying Communication Needs & Pain Points (Parent Responses)

This file contains responses from a survey of parents about their communication needs and pain points with the school's communication system.

| Timestamp | Location | Classroom(s) | Satisfaction with Class Dojo | Feeling about Update Balance | Communication Pain Points | Desired Features |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9/24/2024 15:22:47 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5, 11 | 2 | Too many updates | Because I receive push notifications throughout the day that all look the same, I have started to tune them out, and then miss important notifications such as ""your child is sick, please come pick him up"" or ""please bring diapers"" // also, the teachers are clearly doing a great job capturing and uploading content, and it's wonderful to know what the kids have been up to, but it concerns me that it takes them out of the moment with the children. I'm not even really consuming it all, or at least, I was when they were just starting at Dancing Moose, but now that I've established trust, and I'm busy at work, I don't have time to keep up with it. If it could be better formatted/ summarized and delivered in daily digest form without further burdening the teachers that would be a better use of everyone's time. | Would love to be able to count on one place that has everything - Sometimes important announcements come via flier / email, but not also in Dojo so I miss them. I'd also like it if we could see the names and photos of the other kids in the class, instead of the arbitrary characters. This would help me learn their names and perhaps even foster more community between the parents as well. |
| 9/24/2024 16:06:47 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 12, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | Not enough updates | I'm not sure what my child is doing in photos. | none |
| 9/26/2024 8:40:15 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 11, 13 | 4 | The right balance of updates | In my daughters toddler class I would ideally like the end of day report by 4pm if possible | |
| 9/26/2024 10:10:46 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 3 | Not enough updates | | Maybe a page listing all events or a clickable calender for the year with all activities and the requirements like peace day wear white with alerts |
| 9/26/2024 14:48:26 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 7 | 3 | Not enough updates | I just feel im not getting enough pictures/videos | |
| 9/26/2024 14:55:11 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 3 | The right balance of updates | | |
| 9/26/2024 16:22:06 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 2 | 4 | The right balance of updates | It's fine. Mid but fine | |
| 9/26/2024 16:30:47 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 13 | 4 | The right balance of updates | | Calendar synchronized |
| 9/26/2024 20:26:24 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 3 | 5 | The right balance of updates | None. Its easy, simple and helps with all communication i need | Maybe a page listing all events or a clickable calender for the year with all activities and the requirements like peace day wear white with alerts |
| 9/27/2024 16:13:39 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 13 | 3 | | 5 | Yes |
| 9/27/2024 16:14:47 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 9 | 3 | | Message response rate | Quicker response rate |
| 9/27/2024 16:18:06 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 1, 4 | 5 | I don’t see the school calendar for activities/holidays | NA | I absolutely love it |
| 9/27/2024 16:19:26 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 1 | 5 | Switching accounts because I have multiple classes and duties in class dojo | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:19:51 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 1, 7, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 5 | None, my three kids teachers have always been excellent commentators on it | I like the idea of being able to connect with other parents in the classroom, that can always be tricky to arrange | |
| 9/27/2024 16:20:25 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6 | 4 | Trying to find where the info came from if it’s not on the main page | Information delivered in more places | |
| 9/27/2024 16:20:35 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 5 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:21:20 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 7 | 3 | I don't actually know if my child is having behavior problems. I rarely know what they're studying and my preschooler doesn't tell me what they do during the day. | It would be nice to get occasional reports on classroom behaviors without tracking down a teacher during peak pick up and drop off times. I would also like to understand their schedule better. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:22:47 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 12 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:24:48 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 2, 14 | 5 | I like Class Dojo. I do wish we found contact parents directly. | It would be nice to have the meal calendar in the app. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:25:53 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 9 | 2 | There is not enough communication about my child (in comparison to other daycare) | The other daycare used Brightweel app, I feel like there was more communication through it | |
| 9/27/2024 16:26:16 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 7 | 5 | | It would be good to create special events in the email or something we can add to our device calendar. We currently manually add events to iPhone calendar. The old daycare use Procare where teachers can create events and we can add to our mobile device. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:26:25 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 2, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 5 | It's dependent on something actually being posted. I have no idea what the details of the scarecrow festival are. A post of the flyer on ClassDojo would fix that. Maybe something at the corporate level so so parents are getting the same information about all campus events? | Communicate using one method. Don't email and do ClassDojo. Use one or the other (preferably ClassDojo). I don't want to look in multiple places for things. Email statement is okay. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:28:47 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 10 | 4 | Sometimes hard to find an old announcement or post. | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:28:50 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 7 | 3 | Reporting absences would be nice to have there otherwise pretty happy with it | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:29:01 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 4 | 2 | App is fine, but feels a bit heavy for what we use it for (mostly just communication). Also constantly trying to sell us useless stuff. | If it could include the menu and allow tuition payment, that would be good. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:29:42 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 6, 9 | 1 | Overall haven’t loved it unfortunately. It feels like there are so many features that are supposed to be a game, but we don’t use that. The app doesn’t feel like it was designed for the parents. I also don’t feel l... | I would appreciate daily pictures & updates of my child. I understand it is time consuming, however it really is the only way I get any insight into the class & would make me feel much better! I also don’t love how long it takes for teachers to reply to parents. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:30:20 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 5 | 1 | I don’t get much updates through out the day | It would be nice to give more updates and pictures also provide information like how much did he eat in lunch like fully or mostly or some or none | |
| 9/27/2024 16:30:55 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7 | 5 | If the students are doing regular work it's overload. If they are doing something special like celebrating international peace day than it is fun to see. A personal picture is fine. | NA | |
| 9/27/2024 16:31:00 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 1, 13 | 5 | Class Dojo has a bit of a lag in the video player. I wish I could get more videos and information about my child. | More videos of my kids. More incite into their day-to-day lives and specifically their behaviors and personalities around others. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:31:06 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 4 | 4 | None I like it | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:31:49 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 3 | 3 | Videos takes too much time to download | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:32:01 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:32:03 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5, 11 | 2 | Because I receive push notifications throughout the day that all look the same, I have started to tune them out, and then miss important notifications such as ""your child is sick, please come pick him up"" or ""please bring diapers"" // also, the te... | Would love to be able to count on one place that has everything - Sometimes important announcements come via flier / email, but not also in Dojo so I miss them. I'd also like it if we could see the names and photos of the other kids in the class, instead of the arbitrary characters. This would help me learn their names and perhaps even foster more community between the parents as well. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:33:42 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 11 | 5 | That there are multiple communication streams and I have to remember enough to find something. | I am worried that this implies that urgent things would be communicated in class dojo. I think that that is too possible. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:34:21 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 2, 10 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:35:27 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 10 | 5 | No problem for us | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:36:08 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 4 | 3 | Important information or closures hide in many messages. | Clear messages of things needed or running low for example underpands or clothes for baby on Friday. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:36:54 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5, 11 | 4 | It would be nice if school norms around using it were shared at the beginning of the year. For example- What info should go to admin and what should go to teachers? Which of my kids 3 teachers should I message? If I don't get a response should I assume the message was or wasn't received? What if I message a staff member about a same day thing and they happen to be absent? | Knowing what is on Class Dojo and what is on email. Right now it feels like a mix so I'm not sure what to look for where and how to respond. (Personally, I would prefer email from communication and Dojo just for kid updates like photos etc). | |
| 9/27/2024 16:36:58 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 3, 13 | 4 | It’s difficult to navigate information with 2 children and classrooms. | My child’s name on communication that is relevant to them- events not being hidden | |
| 9/27/2024 16:38:26 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 5 | No academic tracking until parent teacher conferences makes it hard to know what to work on at home. | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:39:19 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 3 | There is not enough sharing of my child’s day, behavior, peer interaction info, etc | The current communication system is great; just increase the information disseminated | |
| 9/27/2024 16:39:41 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 3 | We are currently be overloaded with information of Irelands bad behavior on a daily basis. Brad and I are super confused because we never had behavioral ""problem"" with Ireland in the 2 years at DM. Miss Kylie told us Ireland refused to take the assessment test at the end of the year. That is the only behavioral note we have ever received. Never for summer camps and never from Miss Rylee. Nothing has changed at home. No behavioral changes at home. What has changed is: 2 new teachers, more kids are in her class than ever before, and now she is in class with some of her best friends. Are those factors causing a change in her. Are the teachers expectations too high? Is this typical behavior from a 2nd grader? Today we got formal written repot. Seems serious to get a written report, like her behavior is off the charts enough to take the time to write it down. I will ... | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:40:51 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 13 | 4 | Class Dojo work fine. | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:41:02 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7, 8 | 4 | Offer and promos from class dojo, not always being able to login, messages received too late, difficult to find important info (have to scroll up and down through main page) | Emails from same email source, text messages | |
| 9/27/2024 16:41:32 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 1, 4 | 3 | Instead of just one or two teacher chats for some reason there are a bajillion set up - I also keep getting pushed to upgrade to a paid plan which we are not doing | To know if my kids have had accidents/ gone potty and how much they ate | |
| 9/27/2024 16:42:30 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:44:33 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 3 | Asking for subscription/upgrades | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:45:03 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9 | 4 | The upgrade options at a cost that always pop up with class dojo and that there is even that option. I don’t want to feel like i need to “up grade” at a cost, for information on my child’s day. | Seems good to me | |
| 9/27/2024 16:48:43 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 4 | I do wish we got more updates about our son’s day, but I also understand the teachers are busy teaching 😂 I also feel like sometimes the announcements come last minute (tomorrow is water day!) and then if we miss it, there’s not much time to see it. Suggestion: what if you hired a part-time digital assistant and it was their job to do updates for all the classes? They would probably get to know the kids quickly and could get feedback from teachers on when and where to take pics and videos during what activities. Then the teachers could give the kids their full attention, but pare... | I wish we could report absences in the app, and that the class calendar was easily accessible in the app. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:53:54 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 1, 8, 15 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 16:55:19 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 5 | I think it's great | I haven't had any issues | |
| 9/27/2024 16:55:59 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6 | 5 | I’d love to see the lunch menu on there and school calendar | I think it’s great that you even have this to be honest! Love the descriptions along with pictures. I’d like to see videos too! I had this at the other dancing moose - great updates | |
| 9/27/2024 16:56:57 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 8, 11 | 3 | It’s overwhelming. | I would like to know the theme of the week/month and what concepts my kids are working on directly so we can support and expand at home. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:58:14 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 8 | 4 | None | None | |
| 9/27/2024 16:59:03 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 8 | 4 | The paywall for all features and emails to upgrade | A full featured app that does require additional subscriptions. | |
| 9/27/2024 16:59:14 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:02:05 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 9 | 3 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:02:39 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11, 15 | 4 | I see important information too late | More information on what they are learning academically | |
| 9/27/2024 17:04:59 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9 | 3 | Not enough updates on the child’s activity at school | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:08:52 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7, 12, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 5 | I like it so much better than my other children’s school app. It’s easier to navigate | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:09:37 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 13 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:11:30 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 5 | I don't know if I can use it to report absences. I use the school website to report absences now. | I would like to use it to report absences. | |
| 9/27/2024 17:11:55 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7, 12 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:14:08 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 3 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:17:37 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7 | 5 | It’s for day to day and events and messaging the teacher. We don’t use it for anything else. | This is not related to the app, but I would like dates for events in advance. Just sharing the week of events is not helpful enough. I travel for work and can’t block off an entire week waiting for the school to notify us which class is having an event on which day. That should be planned well in advance. | |
| 9/27/2024 17:20:32 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 5, 6 | 3 | i dont know where to go for school updates on when there is or isnt school or a special day at school | google calendar could work for days that are abnormal or unique - more pics and videos of school days, weekly or at least monhtly update of childs progress | |
| 9/27/2024 17:20:43 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:23:25 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 5 | I would like to be able to report an absence on class dojo | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:23:56 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 15 | 5 | Just need more consistent push notifications. Not sure when I’m missing things. | Just more clear communication on progress | |
| 9/27/2024 17:27:14 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 5 | I want an app for photos/video. It doesn’t work well for urgent/emergency communications. I need a text or phone call to register “this is important” I never know who to message about being late/absent | Mostly I just want a quick daily download from one of the teacher at pickup, especially since Finley has struggled so much to fit in. More in-person please | |
| 9/27/2024 17:31:48 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 3 | I do not receive daily progress reports. | Some sort of daily folder or really anything that tells me how my child did that day. I only receive pictures every once in a while. | |
| 9/27/2024 17:36:46 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 13, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | searching for something - hard to scroll through everything | separate info tabs - i.e. messages, daily updates, photos, event calendar | |
| 9/27/2024 17:38:21 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 4 | None | None | |
| 9/27/2024 17:46:39 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 2, 13 | 4 | Class 13 doesn’t send enough about the kids days. Also we have no idea what they are learning or curriculum (in either class). Knowing what they are covering at least weekly would be appreciated. | Messaging other parents. Seeing report cards or curriculum progress style reports | |
| 9/27/2024 17:50:45 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 2 | 5 | No complaints so far | | |
| 9/27/2024 17:52:58 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 10 | 4 | | | |

| 9/27/2024 18:06:29 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 4 | 4 | No option to search for past reports/photos | Accesss to menu/ calendar in an app. All in one place | |
| 9/27/2024 18:07:48 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 4 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 18:10:08 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 3 | 5 | Can’t think of any - we love the tool! | N/A | |
| 9/27/2024 18:13:09 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9 | 4 | Class dojo communication is great. It’s when I need 1:1 communication with my son’s teachers that we don’t get what we need. The language barrier is very restricting. | | |
| 9/27/2024 18:31:03 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | Getting lots of updates and losing track of them. Sometimes events are posted so early that I forget about them. Sometimes too many reminders. | The ability to link events to my calendar without having to type out the reminder | |
| 9/27/2024 18:40:05 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 7 | 1 | Not enough posts daily, don’t know how my kid eat/nap status. | Update more often | |
| 9/27/2024 18:48:11 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 12 | 5 | None | None | |

| 9/27/2024 19:54:22 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 5 | 2 | Not enough updates on daily activities | | |
| 9/27/2024 20:02:40 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9 | 5 | Videos do not always work when trying to play through the app | Access to school and class room calander with activities by date | |

| 9/27/2024 20:04:45 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5 | 5 | I currently like class Dojo, but I do worry it is a large burden on the teachers to provide updates. | N/a | |
| 9/27/2024 20:07:57 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 3 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 20:12:30 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 2 | 4 | TOO many posts. One or two a day is good i think. | | |
| 9/27/2024 20:24:39 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5 | 5 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 20:25:55 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6 | 2 | Class Dojo keeps asking for paid subscription | Other app like procare it is simple | |
| 9/27/2024 20:27:34 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 7, 9 | 4 | Honestly, probably just that there aren’t enough teachers to keep you updated on behavioral situations or send pictures of your child. | Potentially a text message being sent as well as as a push notification on the app | |
| 9/27/2024 20:33:14 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 1, 10 | 5 | I would like the app for daily updates on the classroom and my child’s progress. For events, school procedures, logistics, etc. I prefer a weekly or monthly email with all information to refer to later | See above | |
| 9/27/2024 20:44:12 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 7 | 3 | Not a big fan of the social media style of the app as it makes it easy to miss important updates, photos etc. I find that the student part of it is totally unnecessary as well, considering my child is too young to use this and I don’t think it’s necessary to award him points for having a snack during the day. The Brightwheel app was used at the last facility we had our son in and I much preferred the platform…and that it was free to us as parents! | | |

| 9/27/2024 21:09:56 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 8, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 3 | It's always trying to get me to upgrade and do some weird points system | Just less clicks. Sometimes class dojo wants too much | |

| 9/27/2024 21:15:29 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 4 | adding eduction to support child at home and always love more pictures :) | none | |
| 9/27/2024 21:20:31 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9, 10 | 4 | Events added a few weeks in advance are lost amongst all other posts and we have to scroll through to find something. Should have categories/tabs/diff sections for the diff types of updates. | See above. | |
| 9/27/2024 21:31:08 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 3 | It might just be that we’re new, but I have a hard time finding anything that’s not in the daily “feed”. Like I saw a notification about a field trip to the museum of ancient life and I have no idea where to find the info that notification was about. | | |
| 9/27/2024 21:31:49 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 4 | Mostly over posting. I think we got 5 or 6 notifications about the early-out day today. A few through email and several through Class dojo. | | |
| 9/27/2024 21:37:54 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 4 | 4 | It’s easy to miss needing to bring in more supplies. Important announcements can be hidden. | A separate and consistent channel for important announcements. | |
| 9/27/2024 21:55:48 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 4 | | | |
| 9/27/2024 22:12:49 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5 | 5 | I like Dojo. I dont like that it’s an expensive app when we already pay a high tuition. | Fixes for all of the above. | |
| 9/27/2024 22:15:25 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 2 | Not enough updates through out the day. Not utilizing the app fully | More updates on a daily basis | |
| 9/27/2024 22:33:44 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 2 | I would say just not knowing how my sons day is at school. Occasionally I will see what he is doing but i would love to see more | I think the communication process is good | |

| 9/27/2024 23:22:38 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 11, 12 | 5 | Individual messaging with other parents, the ability to message more than one teacher (right now I can only message one teacher at a time which is annoying when last year my son’s the classroom had 3-4 teachers and the teachers varied based on the day on the week). I would like it if school wide announcements (fundraiser events, early pickups, school closures, reminders on sick policies, etc) were delivered by email and class dojo was reserved for classroom specific communication like what my child is doing in class that day or signing up for parent teacher conferences or letting us know that a stomach bug is circulating in our child’s classroom. I do like the pinned events feature that pushes an alert to my phone the day of the event because it makes it easier to find information like what my child is supposed to wear each day of spirit week. I also feel like class dojo gives teachers the ability to award points to the children but it’s used really inconsistently so I’m not really sure what to do with them. | | |
| 9/28/2024 0:33:27 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 10, 11 | 3 | It’s sometimes glitchy and can be difficult to tell if communications or posts are directed to you about your child or to all members of the class. Not a lot of behavior updates outside of narratives with the teacher. | More straight forward. Not end up in traps asking you to pay more to use other features of the app. Consistency. Would love to have the class schedule posted to have an easy to reference understanding of what they might be doing (especially if we have to do early pickup or something) would be great to have the child’s goals and progress toward them posted and accessible by parents and teachers in a collaborative way. | |

| 9/28/2024 5:04:13 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 5 | na | having everything in one place like dojo- including the food menu and academic calendar etc. | |
| 9/28/2024 6:08:31 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6 | 5 | None | Dojo seems great so far | |
| 9/28/2024 7:07:20 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 5 | 2 | When my older child was in preschool at dancing moose I would get a daily picture of him and his teacher would talk to me at pick up but that is not happening in this classroom much. Maybe that was because the head teacher was gone. But I would like an update about how his day went at pick up and daily pictures of him so I know how he is doing and what he is learning and doing. | | |
| 9/28/2024 7:26:58 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 15 | 5 | Can't find school calendar. Events and updates on my child are mixed together | add school calendar and meal calendar | |
| 9/28/2024 7:55:29 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 5 | I wish everything could be on one platform. | | |
| 9/28/2024 8:01:22 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 13 | 5 | It keeps asking to purchase subscription. Many useful information is not in the app like payments, menu info etc.. | | |
| 9/28/2024 8:20:42 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 8, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 5 | Pictures and videos of my kids and their learning process | Everything looks good! I’m impressed teachers have time to do this in top of everything else they do! | |

| 9/28/2024 8:49:39 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 9, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 5 | Information overload, but not always helpful | I would like to know more about how I could support at home. Would prefer daily summary, just one post | |
| 9/28/2024 8:58:51 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 11 | 4 | The timeline format makes it difficult to track down important dates/events. | Optional text opt-in, for important school announcements and dates. Emails tend to get lost and forgotten. | |
| 9/28/2024 9:11:18 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 11 | 4 | I don't have a sense of my child's general day - shorter but more comprehensive updates would be great. What he ate, did he sleep, main lesson, main fun activity, one vidoe or photo. But don't want to increase load for the teachers and also want them to be present with my child and not thinking about reporting. A reporting system that's more informative for the parents and more intuitive for the teachers would be ideal. | It would be nice to be able to communicate with the other parents in the class via the app. It would also be nice to have everything centralized - place to pay tuition, place to mark absence, place to communicate with parents/teachers, all in one place. | |
| 9/28/2024 9:12:04 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 5 | App is too busy and information gets lost and becomes confusing. With the free version; I am constantly bombarded with ads to pay for the paid version. Would be nice to have full access to all features without month to month payment and just through my tuition to Dancing Moose. App is too colorful, childlike, and not user friendly. | I like how Ms. Elle uses the event announcement feature and uploads her own details. | |
| 9/30/2024 9:29:35 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 11 | 3 | I would like to know about field trips, special events, etc at least a month in advance so I can arrange my work schedule. | A central location for all announcements. I find it confusing when I have announcements from the teacher and the front desk. Each announcement can be difficult to find. | |
| 9/30/2024 9:38:12 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 6, 11 | 4 | The continuous in-app upsell notifications, either include the upgraded paid version with our tuition, or use an app that doesn't upsell. | with each class having multiple teachers, it would be nice to just have a group chat with the 2 or 3 teachers in one place. Same with administration group chat | |
| 9/30/2024 9:44:31 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 3, 12 | 4 | Having multiple children makes it difficult to understand the general school announcements that don't specify which class it's referring to. | We've loved Class Dojo, the only issue we have had is this year when having multiple students at the school. Things are hard to filter to show only one student at a time. | |
| 9/30/2024 10:12:54 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 11, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 4 | It doesn’t tell you if your message was read | a single spot on the webpage for calendar and clear absent reporting process. Also the ability for us to see our schedules and what was signed up for. Particularly in the summer and begining or transition points in the year. I always forget how much aftercare I signed up for or what summer camps! I am sorry front desk for always calling. | |
| 9/30/2024 10:15:27 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 2, 8 | 5 | App is a little busy with features we do not use, paid upgrades | | |
| 9/30/2024 10:23:02 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 14 | 5 | Wish I could report an absence through it and access the school calendar. | | |
| 9/30/2024 10:25:54 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 11 | 5 | Sometimes I miss updates because the push notification comes at a time I can't see it and then it gets buried | | |
| 9/30/2024 10:37:39 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 3 | 4 | Sometimes there’s “noise”, there’s also so many options about the premium that pops up or we will get notified something is attached to that, but we don’t want to pay premium or utilize those features. | Not 100% sure, but more streamlined or one stop shop for all info. Sometimes having Isaac’s daily routine gets buried in other items. | |
| 9/30/2024 11:05:48 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 10 | 5 | None | | |
| 9/30/2024 11:10:17 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 10 | 5 | I think Class Dojo is fantastic. My only annoyance is the messages I get from the app about tutoring and points. | It would be nice if everything was coordinated through Class Dojo (or equivalent) and I didn't feel I needed to fill out forms outside of Class Dojo or visit the school's website. | |

| 9/30/2024 11:29:31 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 3, 13 | 2 | The ClassDojo system works well, but we would like to receive more photos of our child. She is there five days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., yet we rarely see any updates in her portfolio. Typically, we receive just one or two photos per week at most from her teacher. We would definitely appreciate more photos so we can better understand how she’s doing. | We sent a message to the teacher through ClassDojo to check on our child, but the teacher did not reply. While waiting for her response, we would like to know if she has seen the message. We only reach out on special occasions, such as when we haven't received any photos of our child for four days. In these cases, we want to know how she’s doing and definitely expect a response from the teacher. | |
| 9/30/2024 11:30:02 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 8 | 5 | none | nothing | |
| 9/30/2024 12:43:34 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 2 | 5 | Adds - there are all these features you can get if you subscribe, it's annoying | None | |
| 9/30/2024 12:46:46 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 2, 7 | 5 | We are extremely pleased with the amount of communication we receive via dojo. Both classes share videos/ photos frequently. I wouldn’t typically expect this much insight into their day, and we love it! | I would love more daily information on their behavior, relationships with peers, respect for adults, etc I would like to be able to support them emotionally/ give them suggestions/ provide relevant books/ etc when we debrief afterschool. But I’m not aware of the struggles that might have occurred throughout the day. Unless it requires an incident report. | |
| 9/30/2024 13:44:11 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 4 | Ability to find a carpool with other parents. | My other children's private elementary school uses Verracross which gives parents access to each other's address and contact info for the whole school (unless parents opt out) enabling carpool and playdate set up between parents. | |
| 9/30/2024 14:14:37 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 3 | 5 | It doesn’t encompass everything regarding the school and paying tuition. | Not related but the check in process at drop off is my biggest pain point. It’s chaos trying to have each parent check in on two computers, most people have several kids with them and a stroller or multiple parents, there are kids trying to wash their hands and look at the fish tank. Very overwhelming to walk into every morning. I understand the safety but at other daycares the teachers are checking the child in and out and there is one universal code to get in the building. | |
| 9/30/2024 15:05:05 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8, 14 | 2 | Each teacher uses it at a different capacity, which makes things difficult. Teaches should be required to enter all important information and events via class dojo (external emails/notes/paper/etc. should only be supplemental, not a replacement to dojo) | Have everyone use class dojo to the fullest extent possible (one-stop shop). | |
| 9/30/2024 15:24:21 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 6, I have a graduate from Dancing Moose | 3 | A little overload. With emails and class dojo | Text | |
| 9/30/2024 17:27:24 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 8 | 5 | Class Dojo is great and easy to use. The system works for me. | I think the communication process is very well documented. It helps to keep me informed that you send updates through the many platforms. | |

| 9/30/2024 22:49:22 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 5 | You have to scroll through the feed of you want to refer back to important information or dates. | Somehow separate event information from class updates so it’s easier to find. | |

| 10/1/2024 15:19:13 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 9 | 5 | I wish I could search for past posts about important dates | | |
| 10/1/2024 15:23:21 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12, 16 | 2 | Not enough communication (updates, pictures, portfolio/ individual updates) with our elementary kid. Why is it different for younger kids? | Uploading videos more of an option? I totally understand it takes extra time to post everyday plus adding a description. | |

| 10/2/2024 9:58:37 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 1, 10 | 4 | I like class dojo, but I like it for quick updates. I would rather get fuller school wide email updates or blog posts. | More email communications or videos about larger upcoming events or things we need to know. | |
| 10/2/2024 9:58:54 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 13 | 4 | I would like program/event updates in a more permanent spot than the newsfeed. | | |
| 10/2/2024 9:59:13 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 10 | 4 | Class dojo is fine, but it would be nice if everything was in one place. Very difficult to find information about daily schedule, for example. | Having one place where I can go to find everything instead of teaching down emails or hardcopies of something I received over over year ago. | |

| 10/2/2024 10:03:24 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 9 | 4 | Easier way to contact teachers. | Maybe similar to an email where you can search for names within the network to send a message to. Mostly staff but maybe parents as well. | |
| 10/2/2024 10:03:41 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7, 9 | 5 | I wish I had a way to sort the feed. I have 3 children in two different schools. I sometimes have to scroll a long time before I find what I am looking for each child. | | |

| 10/2/2024 10:48:59 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7 | 3 | Moving from Ms Michelle to kindergarten. The communication is way down but we excepted that. | Just more content, I love the dojo, anytime I ask Mr. T a question he is super responsive. | |
| 10/2/2024 10:51:34 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 10 | 4 | Need to pay for the plus version in order to access full photo library; No place for teacher to easily clock in if they take a nap, most of us have to ask the teacher every time and sometimes I find it bothering too. But knowing if they took a nap helps us adjust our plan after school if we need to. | Add in clock in/check mark box for nap at least, and maybe do more options like meal/potty for toddler program. Much better than the hand writing chart we got when we were in toddler class and it saves teachers’ time! | |
| 10/2/2024 10:52:46 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7 | 2 | Teachers won’t get the message I send till much later. Teachers don’t post enough content throughout the day in my opinion. | | |

| 10/2/2024 11:07:10 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 5 | The main page of announcements is just a stream so I can’t tell if I’ve missed anything new without scrolling back down through everything | Show a ‘read’ on messages sent to the teacher.

Also would like more frequent updates on in-class behavior/learning issues | Maybe if there was a place in the Class Dojo app that had a school calendar, school menu, and a simple form for teachers to fill out as needed to report in-class concerns, and maybe a form for reporting absences | |
| 10/2/2024 16:48:02 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8, 15 | 3 | Different teachers have different systems, lack of one calendar with all key dates for multiple kids, too many emails that are difficult to find later rather than having things organized in one place | One calendar with all events/activities/conderences/field trips/etc, that has notifications/reminders. Ideally could sync with other calendars | |
| 10/2/2024 17:14:30 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 4 | My only issue is that you use an app that requires extra payment for premium pictures like saving pictures and videos. Remind app is free and can also send texts directly so you don’t have to open the remind app or have the remind app pushing notifications. Privacy features are similar to class dojo, where parents can only reply to the teacher when the teacher messages the class. Class dojo has extra unnecessary features and the makes you pay to save pictures of your own kids. That being said. Communication is pretty good but sometimes I wish the teachers sent out more reminders of things coming up. Like i didn’t see the notice about wearing a white shirt till after because i only check class dojo every few days and the announcement was sent out i think the day before. I also missed the memo on picture day because I don’t think it was announced on class dojo. I think i saw something on the door and there was probably an email, but I’ve been bad at checking email. | I don’t mind class dojo, but i think i prefer the Remind app. | |
| 10/2/2024 17:33:22 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 8 | 5 | Some teachers response can be longer than others. It’s hard to tell if teachers will see message on time. Unable to get through via phone due to block hours | Friendly reminders are helpful | |

| 10/2/2024 21:43:18 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 10 | 4 | Not always clear where to find the communication - in a post or message. Kid-specific info should be in the message or the “portfolio” posts. Class/school stuff should be in the posts. | | |

| 10/3/2024 6:43:30 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 5 | Reporting an absence confusion about where to deliver that info, and irrelevant notifications from ClassDojo app about class tutoring, or other features not applicable to my child | Ability to enable and disable which notifications I want from the app | |
| 10/3/2024 9:23:24 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 4, 8 | 4 | Absense reporting, ability to message other parents | | |
| 10/3/2024 11:08:24 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 13 | 4 | Connection finicky | | |

| 10/3/2024 22:17:05 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 7 | 5 | I’m happy with the current communication system. I just wish there was more information on my kid daily activities(or maybe one). I believe, that would help me to encourage and motivate him. | | |
| 10/4/2024 9:44:21 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 10 | 5 | None | It's working great | |
| 10/4/2024 10:34:28 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 16 | 1 | class dojo is easy enough to use, but having a central place for all communications/announcements would be even better instead of emails that will eventually get buried along with the hundreds of emails we receive | the calendar is a bit hard to find, but we do get reminders | |
| 10/4/2024 12:35:16 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 8 | 3 | | Maybe the teacher can use the sticker system on the class dojo to reward students or record misbehaviors so that parents can see how well their children did in general in the classroom! | |
| 10/4/2024 14:07:35 | River Park Campus, South Jordan | 4, 8 | 5 | | I love pictures and videos. It would also be helpful to have other communication such as length of naps, food eaten or not, and any other areas of concern (for example, any emotional struggles during the day) | |
| 10/4/2024 15:36:41 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5 | 3 | Would like more videos | | |

| 10/4/2024 16:29:14 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 12 | 5 | None | Reduce ads from non dancing moose related content | |
| 10/7/2024 11:16:04 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 5 | 3 | Calss Dojo is more like a social media platform, it doesn't have a single page/section with all of my child's status/class info. To find anything mentioned or sent before you have to scroll down the timeline. It would be great to have his progress reports and any specific notes or profile info (like allergies or special needs) all under a single profile page. | | |
| 10/13/2024 9:51:08 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 1, 10 | 5 | Sometimes miss things in the feed | School calendar in the app | |
| 10/13/2024 12:49:15 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 10 | 2 | We don’t like the fact that we can’t reach out directly to a child’s parent in class dojo. Looks like we have to get a teacher to create the chat in order to coordinate something outside of school hours. | Parents information should be accessible | |
| 10/15/2024 10:37:28 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | 12 | 3 | Don't have the app on my phone so usually check it on my computer (have so many messaging apps with my other kids' teachers already). Also, it shows me all the other teachers and schools I've had to use the app with (even from years ago). | If there were different tabs to see daily activities, school announcements, upcoming events, child's progress, etc... | |
| 2/14/2025 22:41:38 | Museum Campus, Lehi | 9 | 1 | Literally minimal communication with staffing changes and apparently behavior issues | Anything would be better | |
