# Hummingbird Mission, Vision, Core Values & Top-Level Business Goals

## Mission Statement

To transform early childhood education by using ethical Al to radically reduce teacher admin, deepen parent-child connection, build vibrant school communities, and bring joy and presence to classrooms where children can thrive.

## Vision Statements

### (Where We're Going Now)

Hummingbird transforms educational communities by liberating teachers from documentation burdens while creating meaningful connections between schools and families. We empower schools to become market leaders through technology that enhances human relationships, turning everyday moments into stories that build trust, loyalty, and educational excellence.

### (Where We're Going in 8 Years)

Hummingbird will be in the pockets of 80% of American preschool families and educators, transforming how early learning is documented, shared, and understood, spanning 85 countries, 75 languages, and eventually assisting +50% of U.S. child-rearing households through our behavioral app, Chickadee Chat. Our platform will change the way we talk to our kids, help rewire generational parenting patterns and accelerate human healing.

**Positive human evolution. Powered by Al, driven by Love.**

## Hummingbird Core Values

1.  **Human Connection:** We believe technology should enhance meaningful relationships, not replace them.
2.  **Teacher Liberation:** We free educators to focus on presence and play, not paperwork.
3.  **Family Empowerment:** We transform parents from observers into active partners in their child's journey.
4.  **Authentic Documentation:** We capture genuine moments that tell meaningful stories, not just checkboxes.
5.  **Educational Excellence:** We elevate the educational experience by connecting school and home seamlessly and tracking key metrics diligently.

## Hummingbird Valuable Final Product

To create highly engaged, confident, and empowered educational communities where:

1.  **Teachers** are liberated from documentation burdens, reconnected with their passion for teaching, and recognized for creating magical moments of learning and growth
2.  **Parents** feel deeply connected to their child's daily experiences, equipped to extend learning at home, and transformed into passionate advocates for their school's approach
3.  **Administrators** lead with confidence through data-driven insights, standardized excellence across classrooms, and a distinctive brand identity that attracts and retains families
4.  **Schools** become recognized market leaders with streamlined operations, reduced staff turnover, waitlists of eager families, and a reputation for innovative parent engagement that competitors strive to emulate
5.  **Children** benefit from a seamless school-to-home experience where important developmental milestones are celebrated, learning is extended beyond the classroom, and their unique journey is documented with care and intention

This community transformation occurs when Hummingbird's technology enhances human connections rather than replacing them, turning everyday documentation into meaningful stories that build trust, loyalty, and educational excellence.
