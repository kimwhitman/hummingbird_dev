| 9/26/2024 17:46:32 | Museum Campus, Lehi | Lead Teacher | 5 | 30-60 minutes | No | Some parents don't communicate online | Lesson planning |
| 9/26/2024 19:32:49 | Garden Campus, West Valley City | Lead Teacher | 4 | 30-60 minutes | Yes | Parents may not read an important message on class dojo, so I will also type the same message to place on my classroom door. We would hate for the child to miss out on an event or a special classroom activity because a parent is not on or checking class dojo. It’s also hard to send a message to a parent when their child is sick because at times they don’t check it. So the child in the end has to sit and wait. Parents are communicating through class dojo and it’s hard to respond when you are teaching. I often have to respond on my lunch break as well as send class dojo pictures and messages. And sometimes when I am at home. | Not sure at this time. |

I usually end up doing it on my lunch break because there isn't time during the day. | It would be nice to be able to do a group message with both the child's parents where both can engage in the same conversation.
