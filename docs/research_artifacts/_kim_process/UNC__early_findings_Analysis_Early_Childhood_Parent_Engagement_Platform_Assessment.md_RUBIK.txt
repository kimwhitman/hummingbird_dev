Executive Summary:
This document presents early findings from Bullseye interviews with teachers, administrators, and parents regarding parent engagement platforms. It highlights significant friction points in the current ecosystem, particularly with ClassDojo, leading to low teacher and administrator satisfaction. Teachers experience daily dread due to system inefficiencies, while admins require constant oversight. Parents are grateful but desire deeper insights into their child's day. The document includes detailed feature prioritization matrices for each stakeholder group, recommending a phased implementation starting with teacher efficiency features.

Stakeholder Insights:
- Teachers: Report frustration (2.5/10 satisfaction) due to systems making their job harder. They are willing to pay for better tools and prioritize a one-click communication hub, smart photo management, and voice-to-text documentation.
- Admins: Show cautious optimism (4/10 satisfaction), requiring manual oversight and seeking standardization in communication and productivity analytics.
- Parents: Express gratitude but yearn for more detail (6.5/10 satisfaction), prioritizing emotional connection through detailed daily insights and learning progression visibility.

Needs and Problems:
- Teachers face communication inefficiencies, manual photo tagging burdens, and inconvenient documentation methods.
