Executive Summary:
This document summarizes parent responses from a survey on communication needs and pain points, primarily concerning Class Dojo. Parent satisfaction with Class Dojo varies, with many rating it 3-5/5, but several express dissatisfaction (scores of 1-2/5). Major pain points include information overload/fragmentation (missing important updates due to excessive notifications or buried information), difficulty finding specific information (events, calendars, past posts), lack of direct parent-to-parent or parent-to-multiple-teacher communication, and the app's "social media" feel or constant upsells for premium features. Parents desire a unified platform for all school communications (calendar, menu, tuition, absence reporting), more frequent and detailed daily updates (including behavior, meals, naps), better media handling (more photos/videos, easier uploads), and direct communication channels. There's a strong preference for consolidated information over fragmented streams (email, flyers, app).

Stakeholder Insights (Parents):
- Satisfaction with Class Dojo: Ranges from 1/5 to 5/5, with many expressing moderate satisfaction (3-4/5). Some prefer other apps like Brightwheel or Remind.
- Communication Balance: Mixed feedback, with some feeling too many updates and others not enough.
- Key Desires: A unified platform, more daily insights, direct communication options, better organization of information.

Needs and Problems:
- Information Overload & Fragmentation: Multiple communication streams (email, Dojo, flyers) cause parents to miss important updates. Excessive notifications lead to tuning out.
- Difficulty Finding Information: Important dates, announcements, and past posts are hard to locate due to the timeline format and lack of categorization.
- Limited Direct Communication: Difficulty contacting other parents directly or messaging multiple teachers at once.
- Media Handling Issues: Videos take too long to download, and there's a desire for more photos/videos and easier uploads/tagging.
- App Design & Cost: Complaints about constant upsells for premium features, the app feeling "too colorful, childlike," and the need to pay for features like saving photos.
- Lack of Daily Detail: Desire for more consistent daily updates on meals, naps, behavior, and learning activities.
- Inconsistent Teacher Usage: Some teachers post frequently, others rarely, leading to inconsistent information flow.
- Urgent Communications: Class Dojo is seen as unsuitable for urgent matters (sick child, urgent needs) due to notification lag.
- Teacher Response Time: Complaints about slow or no replies to messages.

Context Insights:
- Locations: Responses span River Park, Museum, and Garden campuses.
- Classrooms: Parents have children in various classrooms, from infant/toddler to elementary levels.
- Current Systems: Class Dojo is prevalent, but alternatives like Brightwheel, Remind, Procare, and email are also mentioned, often preferred for specific functions.
