Executive Summary:
This document details a comprehensive gamification plan for Hummingbird's teacher content creator. The primary goals are to make content capture fun and lightweight for teachers, produce better parent-facing updates, and motivate teachers through positive reinforcement. The plan outlines specific gamification features including Daily Content Prompts, Capture Modes (photo burst, video snippets), AI Tagging & Captioning, a Content Calendar Assistant, automated Digest Assembly, Teacher Role Sharing, a layered Gamification Layer (points, streaks, badges), Metadata Integration, and a Parent-Facing Outcome focused on curated, personal, and connective updates. It includes detailed UX flows, brand voice guidelines, a points/rewards framework, and storyboard/wireframe descriptions for key screens like the Classroom Leaderboard and Badge Showcase. The overall aim is to transform reporting into a delightful, rewarding rhythm that benefits teachers, parents, and administrators by enhancing communication and connection.

Project Goal:
To design a gamified teacher content ingestion and reporting flow that is fun, light, and motivating, captures better content, automatically generates personalized updates, and creates consistent, high-quality parent feeds, ultimately reducing teacher burden and strengthening parent-school trust.

Teacher Gamification Features:
1.  **Daily Content Prompts:** Morning nudges guiding teachers on content focus (e.g., gym, art) based on daily activities or events.
2.  **Capture Modes:** Photo Burst, Video Snippets with Al auto-selection, Portrait/Lighting Assist.
3.  **AI Tagging & Captioning:** Auto-tags children, recognizes activities, generates educational captions, provides ESL-friendly polish.
4.  **Content Calendar Assistant:** Predicts recurring events, provides smart reminders, and helps draft class-wide updates.
5.  **Digest Auto-Assembly:** Generates per-student TikTok-style video summaries with optional audio narration and connection prompts.
6.  **Teacher Role Sharing:** Distributes roles (Reporter, Connector, Reviewer) daily within 3-teacher classrooms to prevent burnout.
7.  **Gamification Layer:** Points system, streaks, badges (Variety Champion, Team Player), team leaderboards, micro-celebrations.
8.  **Metadata Integration:** Lightweight emoji/voice-to-text for mood, supply requests, incident reports.
9.  **Parent-Facing Outcome:** Curated, personal, story-like updates balancing sweet moments with learning, including daily summary cards and optional digest videos.

UX Flow (Gamified State):
Guides teachers through the day from morning prompts to end-of-day digest review, emphasizing Al assistance and positive feedback.

Brand Voice:
Supportive, fun, non-judgmental, playful, and encouraging.

Points System:
Auto-tracked points for child capture, metadata notes, content variety, and timely digest approval.

Streaks & Badges:
Daily streaks and badges like "Variety Champion," "Team Player," "Quick Capture," "Parent's Favorite," "Consistency Streak."

Team Leaderboards:
Optional classroom-level leaderboards to encourage collaboration.

Micro-Celebrations:
Confetti animations, mascot praise, and end-of-day recap cards for achievements.

Parent-Linked Rewards:
Teacher points increase with parent delight feedback (likes/comments).

Storyboards & Wireframes:
Detailed visual guides for Classroom Leaderboard and Badge Showcase screens, illustrating layout, interaction, copy, and emotional hooks.

Outcomes:
Teachers feel proud and motivated instead of burdened; parents receive high-quality, personal updates; administrators see measurable ROI (teacher hours saved, parent satisfaction up).
