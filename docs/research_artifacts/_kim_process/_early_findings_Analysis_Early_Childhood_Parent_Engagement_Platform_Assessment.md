# *early findings* Analysis: Early Childhood Parent Engagement Platform Assessment

*early findings are based on 3 Bullseye interviews (1 per stakeholder group)*

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of bullseye customer interviews across three stakeholder groups, the current parent engagement ecosystem (primarily ClassDojo) demonstrates significant friction points that create cascading dissatisfaction. The data reveals a classic "systems thinking" problem where individual pain points compound to create organizational-level challenges affecting retention, satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## STAKEHOLDER HAPPINESS ASSESSMENT

### TEACHERS: 2.5/10 Satisfaction

*   **Emotional State:** Frustrated Resignation
*   **Key Indicators:**

    *   Uses unpaid lunch breaks for documentation due to system inefficiency
    *   Expresses "dread" when needing to message parents
    *   Considers paying out-of-pocket for better tools: "I will pay out of my own pocket to have these resources"
*   **Root Cause:** Technology actively impedes core job function (child safety) while adding administrative burden

### ADMINS: 4/10 Satisfaction

*   **Emotional State:** Cautious Optimism with Underlying Anxiety
