### Executive Summary
This document is a comprehensive brand voice guide for "Hummingbird," an AI-powered educational technology platform. It is designed to ensure all automated communications—from chatbots to in-app microcopy—are consistent, empathetic, and aligned with the brand's core essence. The guide defines the brand voice as that of "an experienced Montessori guide who also happens to have an AI PhD," emphasizing a blend of warmth, research-backed credibility, and simple, human language. It details specific voice pillars, tone settings, style conventions, a lexicon of preferred terms, and provides concrete examples for various user-facing scenarios. This is a strategic document aimed at creating a strong, differentiated brand identity through language and tone.

### Market Intelligence
- **Differentiation & Positioning (MKT-DIFF):** This is the core purpose of the guide. Hummingbird is positioning itself not as a cold, efficient tech tool, but as a wise, empathetic partner. The voice is intentionally crafted to be "Heart-Forward," "Scientifically-Sound," and "Empowering," which differentiates it from competitors that might focus solely on features or administrative utility. The mantra "Technology is never the hero; people and their relationships are" is a powerful positioning statement.
- **Go-To-Market (MKT-GTM):** The voice guide is a key tool for GTM execution. It ensures that the first touchpoints a user has with the product (welcome messages, push notifications) immediately establish the brand's unique, premium, and caring identity, which is critical for building trust and driving adoption.

### Contextual Intelligence
- **Pedagogical Context (CTX-DOM-PED):** The brand voice is explicitly rooted in Montessori philosophy. This is evident in the lexicon (e.g., "child-led learning," "joyful presence," "gentle limits") and the core principles of being empowering and respectful of the child. This pedagogical alignment is a key part of the brand's identity and value proposition.
- **Domain & Industry Knowledge:** The guide demonstrates a deep understanding of the early childhood education space by prioritizing warmth, empathy, and trust as the "#1 brand non-negotiable." It recognizes that communication in this domain must be handled with care and sensitivity.

### Stakeholder Insights
- **Customer Definition (STK-CUST):** The guide is built on an implicit understanding of its target users (parents and teachers). It mandates a voice that respects their intelligence ("Cite evidence... without jargon"), acknowledges their emotional state ("Lead with warmth, empathy and trust"), and respects their autonomy ("Offer choices & scripts, never orders"). This shows a customer-centric approach that values users as partners rather than just "users."

### Product Intelligence
- **UX Patterns & Interfaces (PRD-UX):** The guide directly shapes the user experience through its "Approved micro-copy examples." It provides the exact wording for key interface interactions like welcome messages, reminders, error messages, and new feature announcements. This ensures the brand voice is woven into the fabric of the product itself. For example, a system error message is not a cold "Error 404," but a warm, on-brand message: "Hmm, the nest is a bit noisy right now. We're on it—please retry in a moment."
