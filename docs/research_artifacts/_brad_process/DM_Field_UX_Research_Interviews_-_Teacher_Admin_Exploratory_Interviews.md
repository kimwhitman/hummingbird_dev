Her way of remembering what needs to happen every year, is to go back to her last year feed in Dojo and copy paste. Process: 1st Tues of every month @ their weekly meeting they push all the events for the month, she builds them, her team just copies/pastes to share them. Would be great to allow a mentor to post on behalf of her team but the post still looks like it came from the teacher to avoid all of that. She loves Dojo's attendence feature, hit the more button for additional tools she uses: group maker: put the kids in groups, random student chooser (choosing a helper to line up, it won't choose the same student until it goes through the whole class. Timer. Frequenly used tools appear conveniently at the bottom.) Also can toggle between Teacher or Parent view (for teachers who are also parents and have kids at the school) | 0 | | | integrated chatGPT keyboard checks her captions within dojo | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4638Ms. AidaPreschoolDMRivercampus.pdf | IMG_4638Ms. AidaPreschoolDMRivercampus | Ms. Aida | #Teacher #TheESLEducator #Preschool | POST CREATION & MESSAGING | she loves Dojo for photo capture and messaging, the teachers in the classroom take turns posting on the fly during class, uses the workaround (Dojo points to track who's had a photo that week) / no complaints about current parent-teacher comms with Dojo. She thinks it would be great if there was photo recognition and auto post/caption. | 0 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Would love to be able to speak in Spanish and have it translate. Says she wouldn't feel uncomforatable wearing a note pin that she could turn on and off to prompt. Seems skeptical, doesn't currently have to stay after for posting (they team up and do photos on the fly) // she's older, seems like training to learn a new tool seems it could be intimidating | | she has the JR teachers in the class deal with most of the posting, she's more focused on the class | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4644Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.pdf | IMG_4644Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.mov | Ms. Araceli | #Teacher #TheESLEducator #OverwhelmedNewcomer #Toddler | TODDLER PORTFOLIO INFO | here we see the way this team of two manages how they report toddler portfolio Info - Meals, Diapers/Potty, Nap, Mood Tracking (binder/ laminated sheets, markers, photos at the end of the day are uploaded to each child's portfolio one- by-one. Not as good for non-verbal comms within the teaching team but maybe it's not needed in a smaller class format | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4645Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.pdf | IMG_4645Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.mov | Ms. Araceli | #Teacher #TheESLEducator #OverwhelmedNewcomer #Toddler | POST CREATION LANGUAGE TRANSLATION | (we get to see Dojo formatted on one of those wide screen folding phones) (more of a tablet like interface) It looks like language translation is on, so this ESL teacher has Dojo set to run in Spanish in her settings. They capture the pictures during class and do the posts during lunch (too much for an ESL to handle captions in English on the fly.) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4646Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.pdf | IMG_4646Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus | Ms. Araceli | #Teacher #TheESLEducator #OverwhelmedNewcomer #Toddler | POST CREATION,TODDLER PORTFOLIO INFO, VOICE PROMPTING | talking about the time spent in Dojo per day: 20 mins spent during work time updating parents in Dojo during the day, creating captions at lunch, 15-30 mins per day per teacher staying after school to update the toddler portolio info in class dojo. Favorite parts about Class Dojo: Parent-Teacher messaging/communication, Can't think of anything she doesn't like, pretty happy with Dojo. Asked about the potty tracking process in their classroom, they don't use Dojo's native tools for that, they use their laminated sheet in the binder system. Asked her about the lapel pin or voice prompting - she seemed skeptical, she likes writing it down, doesn't always have her phone bc her pants don't have pockets, she's not interested in that. She would love voice prompting for reminders about supplies, she liked the idea of queueing up for review reminders. She says parents pay more attention to the app than what she tells them directly. Messages are better for her than face-to-face parent comms bc she's got her hands full. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4647Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.pdf | IMG_4647Ms. Araceli Toddler DM RiverCampus.mov | Ms. Araceli | #Teacher #TheESLEducator #OverwhelmedNewcomer #Toddler | VOICE PROMPTING, TODDLER PORTFOLIO INFO | trying to use chatGPT, a little skeptical but thinks it would be cool to be able to voice prompt and review a queue of reminders/messages. She really doesn't love the toddler potty chart system they're using/uploading one-by-one to Dojo, would love something digital for toddler potty/food/nap. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4648Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.pdf | IMG_4648Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.MOV | Ashwini (admin) | #Admin | MESSAGING & CALENDAR & POST CREATION & MONITORING: ANNOUNCEMENTS | monitors / keeps track of incidents, sensitive topics with parents, messages, portfolio photo quotos, direct parent messaging, enrollment questions. Her messages are jumbled with the whole feed which is frustrating. Ensuring parents are getting communicaitons. School event announcement templates. Sign up for spring break daycare, talk about how we want tabs for announements: coming this month, what you need, when in one place, viewable seperately, not interspersed in the feed. Desire for everything in one place. Newsletter still needs to happen, but it should correspond to what's on the events tab. They don't know where resources are (link to payment, link to cal, etc) // Science Fair for Elementary Program - get ready check list, voulenteer for field trip chaperone, consent forms, signup & reminders. She complains that she and the teachers are physically having to keep track of this stuff and it's alot. talked about lifting the mental load. Talked about lapel pin / or in-app voice prompting to queue for review. Admin wants to be able to opt in. Privacy concern. Don't want big brother. Interesting, not sure if teachers would want it. Accents brought up. She says voice prompting doesnt work for her bc of her accent. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4651Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.pdf | IMG_4651Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.MOV | Ashwini (admin) | #Admin | MESSAGING & MONITORING | Admin needs two toggles in messages, one just for her, one for monitoring all messages so she doesn't loose track of the ones just for her. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 3/5/2025 | IMG_4652Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.pdf | IMG_4652Ashwini_Admin_DM River Campus.MOV | Ashwini (admin) | #Admin | MONITORING | talking about how they don't really use the point system in Dojo the way it was designed, they're using it as a workaround to track things like was a photo taken. talking about curriculum tracking process. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

This teacher looks at what she's posted lately per child, and tries to take a different photo each time for more variety in thier portfolio, (mind noise they have to deal with that saps them of creative energy) | | they use Dojo's point system as a workaround to share non-verbally with e/o about which child has had their portfolio photo uploaded that week. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
