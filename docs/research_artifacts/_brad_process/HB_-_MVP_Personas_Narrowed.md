# NARROWED for MVP: HB Target Market, Product Outcome & Ideal Buyers

## 1. Target market:

Progressive early childhood education leaders, school owners, directors, and curriculum leads; who are tired of outdated tools that burden teachers, create parent confusion, and fail to reflect the heart of their program. They want a modern solution that aligns their team, delights parents, and frees teachers to teach.

We also serve the overwhelmed parents of toddlers and preschoolers who want to feel more connected, confident, and informed, but don't have time to chase down updates or interpret vague school communications.

And the teachers and staff who are passionate about working with children but are bogged down by the admin tasks and tech that don't support their flow, voice, or needs.

We want all three groups, admins, teachers, and parents, to experience Hummingbird and advocate for it everywhere they go, saying:

>"We used this at our last school. You have to check it out. It changes everything."

## 2. Product and outcome?

A beautifully designed, Al-powered parent engagement and classroom documentation platform, white-labeled for schools, that automates the admin burden, captures magical moments in real-time, and delivers emotionally rich digests to parents.

Hummingbird empowers educators, delights parents, and helps visionary schools stand out, building loyalty, reputation, and impact while freeing everyone to do what matters most: be present with the child.
